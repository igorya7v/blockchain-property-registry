# Description

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Smart Contracts could be used to build a decentralised property (Real Estate) ownership and management system.

The Smart Contract in this example is build on the Ethereum platform using the Solidity programing language.

For the learning purposes the code was written with keeping the simplicity and readability in mind instead of focusing on efficiency and best practices. 

The property management system is a service which maintains the records of the Real Estate properties and allows to verify and transfer ownership.  

In order to keep things simple we will define a very simplified requirements:

1. Only the Owner of the Smart Contract can record (input) a new property into the system.

2. Only the Owner of the Smart Contract can assign an initial owner of the property.

3. Only the Owner of the Property can transfer the property ownership to a new owner.
